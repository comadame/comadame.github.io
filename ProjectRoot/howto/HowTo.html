<center><h1>DIY Gold Foiling Technique</h1></center>


<h3>Materials:</h3>
<ul>
   <li>a laminator</li>
   <li>laser prints</li>
   <li>blank scrap paper</li>
   <li>reactive foil of your choice</li>
</ul> 
<br />



<p>First, you'll want to gather materials.  An inexpensive laminator, some laser printed material (black and white), some blank scrap paper (for covering your design), and reactive foils in colors of your choice will be needed for this tutorial.</p>

<p>If you haven't done so already, print your design in black and white using a laser printer.  This technique will not work with inkjet prints. </p>

<p>Next, cut your choice of foil to a square shape that covers the parts of your design you'd like to make nice and shiny! Don't worry about getting a perfect shape, you'll want to just focus on covering as much surface area of your design as you can.  </p>

<p>Place your cut foil directly on top of the design, shiny side UP. Then sandwich it carefully in between two sheets of plain computer paper. You can even fold one piece of paper in half and sandwich it into that, so long as the design is covered by a layer of foil + computer paper.</p>

<p>Run it through the laminator.  Follow the directions carefully for your brand of laminator, You can keep your laminator "clean" by passing cardboard paper through it a couple of times. </p>

<p>Gently pull the foil off to reveal your newly foiled laser print.  It's already dry!</p>
