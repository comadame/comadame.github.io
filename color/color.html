	<h2>Color Models</h2>
	<p></p>
	<h3>Analogous</h3>
	<p>are groups of three colors that are next to each other on the color wheel, with one being the dominant color, which tends to be a primary or secondary color, and a tertiary. Red, orange, and red-violet are examples.</p>
  <h3>Monochromatic</h3>
	<p>are groups of three colors that are next to each other on the color wheel, with one being the dominant color, which tends to be a primary or secondary color, and a tertiary. Red, orange, and red-violet are examples. </p>
	<h3>Triadic</h3>
	<p>A triadic color scheme uses colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel. Triadic color harmonies tend to be quite vibrant, even if you use pale or unsaturated versions of your hues.</p>
	<h3>Complementary</h3>
	<p>colors directly opposite each other in the color spectrum, such as red and green or blue and orange, that when combined in the right proportions, produce white light.
